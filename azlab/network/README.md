# Azure Network Lab

This lab follows [Secure and isolate access to Azure resources by using network security groups and service endpoints](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/secure-and-isolate-with-nsg-and-service-endpoints/).

There are two scripts. One for following the lab, 
and the other for extracting information from azure 
if the lab were followed.
